# Crafty

Crafty is an app designed for brewery owners and brewery lovers alike. It provides a platform for brewery lovers to sign up, review, and rate their favorite beers in a beer journal, while allowing brewery owners to post information about their brewery, including events, new beers, directions, operational times, and contact information.

As a team leader, I was involved in various aspects of Crafty's development, including designing the APIs for the backend, as well as contributing to the visual design of the app. Here's a brief overview of the features and functionalities of Crafty:

# Features

**Beer Journal**

Crafty allows brewery lovers to sign up and create their own beer journal, where they can keep track of their favorite beers. They can write reviews, rate beers, and add notes about their tasting experiences. The beer journal is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, making it easy for users to manage and explore their beer collection.

**Brewery Information**

Brewery owners can create and manage their brewery profiles on Crafty. They can provide information such as events, new beers, directions to their brewery, operational times, and contact information. This allows brewery owners to effectively communicate with their customers and keep them updated about their brewery's offerings and activities.
